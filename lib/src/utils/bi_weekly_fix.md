# Bi-Weekly Calculation Fix

## Issue
The current bi-weekly calculation in `calculator_provider.dart` line 719 incorrectly calculates the bi-weekly interest rate as:
```dart
final double r = _interestRate! / 100 / 26;
```

This is mathematically incorrect because it treats the annual interest rate as if it compounds linearly.

## Correct Formula
The bi-weekly interest rate should be calculated using the periodic rate formula:
```dart
final double annualRate = _interestRate! / 100;
final double biWeeklyRate = pow(1 + annualRate, 1/26) - 1;
```

## Changes Needed in calculator_provider.dart

Replace lines 719-727 with:

```dart
// Correct bi-weekly rate using periodic interest rate formula
// Convert annual rate to effective bi-weekly rate: (1 + r_annual)^(1/26) - 1
final double annualRate = _interestRate! / 100;
final double biWeeklyRate = pow(1 + annualRate, 1/26) - 1;
final double biWeeklyPayment = _payment! / 2;

// Calculate new term with bi-weekly payments
double currentBalance = _loanAmount!;
int periods = 0;
double totalInterest = 0;

while (currentBalance > 0 && periods < 1500) { // Max 1500 bi-weekly periods (~57 years)
  final double interestPaid = currentBalance * biWeeklyRate;
```

This fix ensures accurate bi-weekly payment calculations and interest savings.
