  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Step 3: Add Flutter to PATH

**Option A: Using PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Administrator
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\flutter\bin",
    "User"
)
```

**Option B: Using System Settings**

```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\flutter\bin"
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
