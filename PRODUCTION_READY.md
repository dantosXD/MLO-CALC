- **Chart visualizations** using fl_chart for amortization analysis
- **State persistence** using shared_preferences
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - 16 unit tests for all calculations
- **Zero static analysis warnings** - flutter analyze passes clean

## 📊 Accuracy Improvements

### Financial Calculations
1. **Payment Calculation**: Uses precise formula M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
2. **Interest Rate Solving**: Newton's method with 0.0001% tolerance (100 iterations max)
3. **Amortization**: Final payment precisely adjusted to clear remaining balance
4. **PITI**: Proper monthly conversion of annual amounts (tax/insurance)

### Number Formatting
- Currency: `$1,234.56` with proper thousand separators
- Percentages: `5.250%` with 2-3 decimal precision
- Years: "30 years" or "5 years, 6 months" with proper singular/plural
- Compact currency: `$1.2M`, `$350K` for large numbers

## 🎨 Modern UI Features

### Visual Enhancements
- **Animated number display** with fade-in slide transitions
- **Button scale effects** (95% scale on tap)
- **Gradient backgrounds** for display area
- **Elevated buttons** with proper shadows and rounded corners (16px radius)
- **Color-coded buttons**:
  - Primary functions (L/A, Int, Term, Pmt): Primary container color
  - Arithmetic ops (+, -, x, /): Tertiary container color
  - Clear button: Error container color (red tones)
  - PITI buttons: Semi-transparent primary container

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation bar with 4 sections
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Side navigation rail with extended labels
- **Adaptive layout**: PITI buttons only visible on wide screens
- **Flexible grids**: Calculator buttons expand/contract with screen size

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Loan Calculation
1. Enter loan amount: `300000` → `[L/A]`
2. Enter interest rate: `5` → `[Int]`
3. Enter term in years: `30` → `[Term]`
4. Payment automatically calculated and displayed

### Calculate Interest Rate
1. Enter loan amount, payment, and term
2. Rate automatically calculated using Newton's method
3. Result displayed as annual percentage (e.g., 5.250%)

### PITI Calculation
1. Calculate basic payment first
2. Add property tax: `3600` → `[Tax]` (annual)
3. Add insurance: `1200` → `[Ins]` (annual)
4. Press `[Pmt]` again to toggle PITI display

### Amortization
