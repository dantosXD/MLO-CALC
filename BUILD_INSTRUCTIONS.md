## 🔍 Testing the New Features

### Test Input Validation:
1. Try entering more than 15 digits

2. Note the total interest over the life of the loan
3. Check bi-weekly conversion
   - Expected: Interest savings displayed
   - Expected: Shorter payoff time

### Test Error Handling:
1. Try to calculate payment without entering loan amount
   - Expected: Clear error message (not silent failure)
2. Check logs for any crashes
   - Should see `debugPrint` messages instead of silent errors
