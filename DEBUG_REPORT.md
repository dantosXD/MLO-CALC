- [ ] Dart SDK installed (3.9.0 or later)
- [ ] Run `flutter doctor` to check setup
- [ ] For Android: Android SDK installed
- [ ] For Web: Chrome or Edge browser available

### 7. Common Build Errors & Solutions

#### Error: "flutter: command not found"
**Solution**: Add Flutter to PATH
```bash
# Windows
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\flutter\bin

# Verify
flutter doctor
```

#### Error: "Waiting for another flutter command to release the startup lock"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Delete lock file
rm C:\Users\207ds\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\.flutter_tool_state
```

#### Error: "Gradle build failed"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk
```

### 8. Testing Recommendations

#### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test test/calculator_provider_test.dart
```

#### Widget Tests
```bash
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

### 9. Performance Considerations

#### Optimizations Applied
- ✅ Stateless widgets where possible
- ✅ Provider for state management (efficient)
- ✅ Const constructors used appropriately
- ✅ Keys for list items and animated widgets

#### Future Optimizations
- Consider lazy loading for amortization schedules
- Implement pagination for large schedules
- Cache calculations when inputs don't change

### 10. Security Considerations

#### Data Persistence
- ✅ Uses SharedPreferences for local storage
- ✅ No sensitive data stored
- ✅ Financial calculations performed locally

### 11. Deployment Readiness

#### Android
- ✅ Code ready for build
- ⚠️ Update app icon (if needed)
- ⚠️ Update AndroidManifest.xml metadata
- ⚠️ Configure signing for release build

#### Web
- ✅ Code ready for build
- ⚠️ Update web/index.html metadata
- ⚠️ Configure web icons and manifest.json

### 12. Next Steps

1. **Install Flutter SDK** (if not already installed)
2. **Run `flutter doctor`** to verify setup
