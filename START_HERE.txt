CURRENT STATUS: Flutter SDK Not Installed
Your app is ready, but Flutter needs to be installed first!

================================================================================
                     QUICK START (3 EASY STEPS)
================================================================================

STEP 1: INSTALL FLUTTER SDK
----------------------------
Open PowerShell AS ADMINISTRATOR, then run:

    cd C:\Users\207ds\Desktop\Apps\MLO-CALC
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    .\install-flutter.ps1

This will download and install Flutter automatically (takes 5-10 minutes).


STEP 2: CLOSE AND REOPEN YOUR TERMINAL
---------------------------------------
After installation, you MUST close and reopen your terminal for Flutter to work.


STEP 3: SETUP AND TEST
----------------------
Run this batch file:

    setup-and-test.bat

This will install dependencies, run tests, and let you choose what to build!


================================================================================
                         ALTERNATIVE: MANUAL STEPS
================================================================================

If you prefer manual control:

1. Download Flutter:
   https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows

2. Extract to C:\flutter

3. Add C:\flutter\bin to your PATH

4. Run these commands:
   flutter pub get
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   flutter run -d chrome          (for web)
   flutter build apk --release    (for Android)
